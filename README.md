# Physics-Computer Science Projectile Simulation

Accurate HTML canvas simulation of a projectile in motion. 
Change certain initial conditions (eg. initial speed, angle, etc.) and watch the trajectory of the ball change; try to hit the target to win!

Written as my joint final project for Grade 12 Physics and Computer Science.

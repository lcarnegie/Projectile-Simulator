# Physics-Computer Science Projectile Simulation

Accurate HTML canvas simulation of a projectile in motion. 
Change certain initial conditions (eg. initial speed, angle, etc.) and watch the trajectory of the ball change! 

My combined Grade 12 culminating project between my Physics and Computer Science courses.
